# Trace

A simple game meant to demonstrate the use of gun in collaborative, real-time web applications.

## Trying it out

> **Note:** still in beta! The game is rough around the edges.

In your terminal, run:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/PsychoLlama/Trace.git`
 2. `cd Trace`
 3. `npm i`
 4. `node server`

Now the game should be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

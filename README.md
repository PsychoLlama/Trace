# Trace

A simple game meant to demonstrate the use of gun in collaborative, real-time web applications.

## Trying it out

> **Note:** still in beta! Instructions are rough around the edges.

Run `$ git clone <trace>` in the terminal. Install everything by running
`$ npm i`, then update the `gun` version by going to their develop branch
and copying the file into `node_modules/gun/gun.js`.
Start serving up the page by running `$ node server` in the terminal.

> Very rough around the edges. Hit me up on [gitter](http://gitter.im/PsychoLlama) if you have questions.

Now the game should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

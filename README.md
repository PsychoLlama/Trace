# Trace

A simple game meant to showcase [gunDB](http://gun.js.org/) in a real-time app.

## Trying it out

> **Note:** this isn't actively maintained, but it still runs! You can play it live [over here](http://tracegame.herokuapp.com/).

In your terminal, run:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/PsychoLlama/Trace.git`
 2. `cd Trace`
 3. `npm install`
 4. `npm start`

Now the game should be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
